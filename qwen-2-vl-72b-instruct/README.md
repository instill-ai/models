# Qwen2 VL 72B Instruct

## ðŸ“– Introduction

Key Features:
- SoTA understanding of images of various resolution & ratio: Qwen2-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on visual understanding benchmarks, including MathVista, DocVQA, RealWorldQA, MTVQA, etc.

- Understanding videos of 20min+: Qwen2-VL can understand videos over 20 minutes for high-quality video-based question answering, dialog, content creation, etc.

- Agent that can operate your mobiles, robots, etc.: with the abilities of complex reasoning and decision making, Qwen2-VL can be integrated with devices like mobile phones, robots, etc., for automatic operation based on visual environment and text instructions.

- Multilingual Support: to serve global users, besides English and Chinese, Qwen2-VL now supports the understanding of texts in different languages inside images, including most European languages, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Vietnamese, etc.

## ðŸ”„ Compatibility Matrix

To ensure smooth integration, please refer to the compatibility matrix below. It outlines the compatible versions of the model, [`instill-core`](https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core), and the [`python-sdk`](https://github.com/instill-ai/python-sdk).

| Instill Core Version | Python SDK Version |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| >= v0.51.0           | >= v0.18.0         |

> **Note:** Always ensure that you are using compatible versions to avoid unexpected issues.

## ðŸš€ Preparation

Follow [this](../README.md) guide to get your custom model up and running! But before you do that, please read through the following sections to have all the necessary files ready.

#### Install Python SDK

Install the compatible [`python-sdk`](https://github.com/instill-ai/python-sdk) version according to the compatibility matrix:

```bash
pip install instill-sdk=={version}
```

#### Get model weights

To download the fine-tuned model weights, please execute the following command:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct-AWQ
```

## Test model image

After you've built the model image, and before pushing the model onto any **Instill Core** instance, you can test if the model can be successfully run locally first, by running the following command:

```bash
instill run admin/qwen-2-vl-72b-instruct -g -i '{"prompt": "whats in the pic? describe in one sentence", "image-url": "https://artifacts.instill.tech/imgs/bear.jpg"}'
```

The input payload should strictly follow the the below format

```json
{
  "prompt": "..."
}
```

A successful response will return a similar output to that shown below.

```bash

Here is the list of flags supported by `instill run` command

- -t, --tag: tag for the model image, default to `latest`
- -g, --gpu: to pass through GPU from host into container or not, depends on if `gpu` is enabled in the config.
- -i, --input: input in json format
